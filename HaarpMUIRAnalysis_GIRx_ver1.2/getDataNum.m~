%
%       GISRIDataNum_YYYYMMDD.txt needs to be located in the same directory
%       level as the GIRx data.
%
%       This file contains a mapping of the experiment numbers from the
%       SRIRx to the GIRx. The layout of the file is VERY IMPORTANT. 
%       All fields need to be seperated by EXACLY as single space or tab.
